# WordleAssistant

Project inspired by watching a friend playing Wordle and getting stuck on what word to enter.
This project allows users to insert their guess in a Wordle, set the type to each letter that their guess had and get a list of possible words to try next. It just has a limitation that if some letter occurs too much, then in wordly it appears as absent, in this project, that letter should be left without any type, as it was complex to make that logic and making it wouldn't be any fun.
The logic of the project was initially in a single .js file, but as the amount of code grew, it became complicated to navigate in a single file, so it was refactored to utilise MVC architecture.
